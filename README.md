# ---------- // Danny's Diner SQL Case Study \\ ----------

## Overview

This project involves a case study for Danny's Diner, a restaurant specializing in Japanese cuisine. The objective is to analyze customer data using SQL queries to derive insights for business decisions. The dataset provided includes three key tables: `sales`, `menu`, and `members`.

## Problem Statements

Danny, the owner of the diner, seeks answers to various questions about customer behavior, spending patterns, and menu popularity. The goal is to assist in decision-making, particularly regarding the expansion of the customer loyalty program.

## Expertise Demonstrated (SQL Skills)

The project showcases a range of SQL skills, including:

* **Joins**: Utilized JOIN statements to combine data from different tables (`sales`, `menu`, `members`) based on common keys.
* **Aggregation**: Employed aggregate functions such as SUM and COUNT to derive meaningful insights from the data.
* **Window Functions**: Leveraged window functions like ROW_NUMBER() and DENSE_RANK() to analyze ordered data within partitions.
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Utilized CTEs to simplify complex queries, enhancing readability and maintainability.

## Problem-Solving

Each problem statement was addressed methodically, considering the specific requirements of Danny's Diner. The solutions provided clear and concise answers to the questions posed.

## Queries Overview

1. **Total Spending**: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. **Visit Count**: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. **First Purchase**: What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. **Most Purchased Item**: What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. **Customer's Favorite Item**: Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. **First Purchase as a Member**: Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. **Last Purchase Before Membership**: Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. **Pre-Membership Spending**: What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. **Points Calculation**: If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. **First Week Points**: In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

## Conclusion

This SQL case study demonstrates strong skills in data analysis and query writing. By answering Danny's questions, it provides valuable insights for enhancing customer experience and loyalty programs at Danny's Diner. The use of SQL expertise and problem-solving abilities is evident throughout the project.
